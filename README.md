# PowerBi_Timeline_Analysis_COVID-19
I have used Python and Power BI in order to create a CoronaVirus Report with summary statistics, trends and forecasts.

This repository contains:

Datapreprocessing code in Python which I have used on the dataset available here - https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/ to extract final dataset (ipynb format).

Both the datasets Preprocessing and Final are provided in zip format.

COVID-19 Dashboard Power BI file which you can download in pbix format.
